# coffee time

coffee time is a cross-platform mobile application built in react native.

I make pour-over coffee every day but I often get distracted while doing so. When I wander off my carefully measured and timed coffee goes forgotten until it is too late and my scale has reset. The solution in the past has been using my phones built in timer to remind me of my coffee duty. Add to that jumping back and forth to the calculator app to get the coffee to water ratio just right, and its often more than I'd like to think about before I've had my coffee in the morning.

Enter coffee time! Get your recipe just right and never forget your next pour again thanks to built in timers and alarms. 

Recipes include chemex, aeropress, and french press.
